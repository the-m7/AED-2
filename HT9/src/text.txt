dorabae-basic12 is a 2.0 Harder 6* level created by Dorabae and the only one created in 2.0 besides Dorabae-Quiz. This is the last of the Dorabae-Basic levels he created before he quit. The level boasts a simple style, but with complicated rotating choreographs, using lots of triggers. Although being a basic level, players claim that is exceptionally difficult and probably deserves a higher rating. Dorabae apologized for this and promised that Dorabae-Basic 13 would be easier, but he quit Geometry Dash after posting Dorabae-Quiz. The level starts with a simple cube section. Here, the player must jump and hit the jump orbs with decent timing to not crash into spikes. The cube then transitions to a ship, featuring saw-blades and moving thorns, then to a simple but annoying ball segment due to invisible portals and rings that appear at the last moment. Then, another cube section appears, but is very easy and requires few jumps. When the drop starts (the same as Sine Wavs) an annoying robot section appears and is clunky to control due to teleportation portals, double speed, and precise timings. The following sequence is slightly easier but still annoying. It is a fast wave segment with moving slopes and many confusing portals. More or less the same thing happens during the UFO, even if the style changes. The level ends with a tricky cube section, featuring a moving platform with rising, falling, and rotating hazards and, again, some annoying invisible teleportation portals. The level concludes with the level's name appearing with a spiral transition.
